# About

Hi, my name is Stefan Joachimsthaler.

I am a father of two (mostly) wonderful boys, husband, geek, nerd and developer.

I'm working as a Senior Software Developer at [e.Optimum](https://www.eoptimum.de/).

I am always trying to learn new skills and try to share the stuff that I learded with others.

I focus mainly on DotNet especially C#.
